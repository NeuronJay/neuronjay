### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**neuronjay** holds âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ meaning to me as it reminds that everthing is acheivable once you set your mind on it. 
Hence, the name neuron(brain) 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Snoolink - https://snoolink.me which helps creates beautiful looking personal websitese from your social media data.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular JS, Swift. I am always in lookout for new things in Python aspect - Django and ML

ðŸ‘¯ I am happy to have people work on the snoolink idea or I always ears for any exciting idea.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a robust data extraction system for all the top social media platforms.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about about what was the recent bug that I spent hours fixing, or my last TV show that I binge-watched.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I am not coding or ranting about the bugs, I enjoy writing.
